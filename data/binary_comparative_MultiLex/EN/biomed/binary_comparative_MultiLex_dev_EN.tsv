For example, ectopic application of BMP antagonists demonstrates that BMP signaling is necessary for this process, and in its absence, webbing occurs [17–19]).	0.04	0.27	7.0	2.0	0.0	0.0	4.90874894074365e-05	11.0	4.0	2.5758293035489	6.0	5.856051367904705e-05	0

Interestingly, Bauer and colleagues previously identified a locus (Cia28) associated with anti-CII antibody production at 53 cM on chromosome 13 [19], which is approximately at the same position as where we find the linkage for this trait in the present study.	0.04	0.26	7.0	2.0	0.0	0.0	4.90874894074365e-05	10.0	2.0	0.0	0.0	1.9807232567912972e-05	0
