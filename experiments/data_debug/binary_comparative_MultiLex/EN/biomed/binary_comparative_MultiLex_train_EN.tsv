disturbance	efficiency	biomed	It has been reported that inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis by chemical inhibitors of Dhcr7 also led to a disturbance of the Shh signaling with abnormal embryogenesis [27,28], and severe sterol deprivation can indeed inhibit the processing of transfected Shh in cultured mammalian cells [29].	Our data suggest that the efficiency of micro- and nanovesicle formation is not significantly different in wild type and mutant red blood cells.	0.25	0.28	11.0	3.0	2.2460161996022623	6.0	8.611840246918683e-06	10.0	4.0	2.161213498529485	8.0	4.305920123459342e-05	0

Other defects included absence or hypoplasia of the pineal gland, cortical polymicrogyria, white matter changes in the corpus callosum and grey matter changes in the cerebellum [11-13].	0.25	0.32	5.0	2.0	2.5758293035489	6.0	2.066841659260484e-05	5.0	1.0	2.255917004354656	6.0	7.750656222226815e-06	0
