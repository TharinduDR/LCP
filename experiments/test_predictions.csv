biomed antagonists	While they do have their limitations (e.g. developmental compensation and strain effects in mouse lines not backcrossed adequately to a parental strain for a minimum of 10 generations), use of our inbred (N20 generation) animals in the present study (where no differences in locomotor behavior were detected between D2R-/- and D2R+/+ mice; Figs. 1 &2) revealed a previously unappreciated role of D2R-mediated signaling in associative learning and attention that could not be measured with the currently available, acutely administered D2R antagonists.	0.4666666666666667	0.463134765625

europarl freedom	Since then, this great island republic has experienced a lot of ups and downs, the ups and downs of a dictatorship and of attempts to move towards freedom, of economic crises and of developments towards a market economy, which were then continually stifled in a quagmire of corruption, mismanagement and, unfortunately, constant authoritarian incursions.	0.203125	0.25244140625

europarl resources	On the other hand, not to speak of the situation of this small country that has been orphaned in terms of its development, having been stripped of its natural resources of the kind that often attract donors, would have been unthinkable.	0.2125	0.2374267578125

europarl revision	The Commission, in its revision of the Working Time Directive, should take account of the view of the hundreds of organisations from across Europe federated in the newly established alliance, because such a large association cannot be ignored when creating laws.	0.2166666666666666	0.268798828125
europarl revision	However, Parliament is saying that this should not become the usual procedure and that we should actually proceed here in accordance with the ordinary Treaty revision procedure.	0.2222222222222222	0.340576171875

europarl exemption	Secondly, what does the Commission think about the horizontal agreements that are not covered by the exemption regulations on specialisation or research and development.	0.2941176470588235	0.353515625
europarl exemption	We have therefore raised the threshold for exemption from the threshold requirements, which ultimately saddle SMEs with red tape and costs, from EUR 2.5 million to EUR 5 million.	0.3166666666666666	0.324951171875
europarl migrants	We do, however, have one key point, which is the question of voting rights for migrants in the European Union, not because we reject enfranchisement in general but because we take the view that subsidiarity should apply to such decisions.	0.21875	0.310302734375
europarl migrants	I understand that some of you have expressed concern about the recognition or regularisation of illegal migrants, but I am also concerned with the battle we have to fight in each Member State against undeclared work.	0.2368421052631579	0.316650390625

europarl legislation	However, my report also criticises the fact that the complex interaction of European legislation and national transposition has not resulted in a simplification and debureaucratisation of public procurement, as was, in fact, the aim of the 2004 revision, but rather in more work, high external costs for legal advice and protracted procedures.	0.2794117647058823	0.27392578125

europarl investment	The report points out certain fundamental aspects: investment in decentralisation; promoting the empowerment of fishermen and the entire fishing industry to have decision-making powers; giving them greater involvement in managing fishing, which will also allow a policy of compliance and responsibility; the need to draw a distinction between small-scale and industrial fleets, with specific regulations for each; the need to appraise management models that are better adapted to different fishing areas and different types of fisheries; the importance of strengthening the market by fishing that is aimed at value-added products and increasing the first-sale price; linking subsidies with good practice; regulation of the modernisation of the fleet in terms of safety and hygiene; decisive development of aquaculture, which is ecologically sustainable within the European Union; and the development of other sectors involved in catching or processing fish.	0.3235294117647058	0.259033203125

europarl shortcomings	The centralisation of the application of Article 81(3) - through a priori control by the Commission, toned down by means of the exemption regulations from the 1980s onwards - was a victim of its own success; the demand for more and better competition revealed its economic inefficiency and its legal shortcomings.	0.34375	0.2939453125

europarl coastlines	This resolution refers to two matters of great importance to European citizens: maritime safety and the protection of the marine environment, that is, the protection of our coastlines, our bays and our beaches.	0.35	0.31982421875
europarl expenditure	While fines in the field of competition policy are entered as general budget revenue, the amounts to be paid require the creation of a budget item in the expenditure side of the budget, which does not exist at the moment.	0.3529411764705882	0.35546875
europarl expenditure	This new approach is based on the calculation of maximum eligible expenditure, rather than a flat-rate reduction in the percentage of cofinancing.	0.421875	0.34130859375
europarl reprocessing	We have succeeded in getting the crucial improvements on which we had decided accepted, those being the clarification of reprocessing, where the Commission has promised us a directive specifically relating to the subject; clarification of the position of software, of databases and the phasing out and labelling of carcinogenic and mutagenic substances.	0.3571428571428571	0.43359375

europarl fragmentation	Thirdly, the decision made in the past to opt for minimum harmonisation, thereby allowing the Member States to retain specific national provisions, has resulted in fragmentation of the legal environment, given that the rules in force lay down a minimum European standard but do not define a single method for meeting it.	0.375	0.426513671875
europarl statehood	That addition reads as follows: 'where this does not require statehood, for instance, in the ILO'.	0.375	0.301025390625

europarl endeavour	I guarantee you that the debate that we have today will be translated with urgency into all the languages so that should there be any breakdown in the ordinary procedures for interpretation - although it would not be optimum nor entirely consistent with the Rules of Procedure - I will use every endeavour to inform people in all languages at the earliest stage.	0.4166666666666666	0.42333984375
